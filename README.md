# Brute Force - Lock Overhaul SKSE

This is my first SKSE plugin. Other mods exists like this, but couldn't find one that did it in an SKSE plugin, so used it as a learning experience. Will probably work on this more to polish it, but for now I'm pretty stoked about it!

**What does it do different?**

I love playing as dumb barbarians that wouldn't care about lockpicking, but I also don't like restraining myself to a set level cap in order to access loot. Mostly because Skyrim, obviously, wasn't built that way. So instead of setting a minimum skill level in order to break open locks, I set a requirement for equipment instead.

The idea being that locks of a harder degree would be more sturdy and harder to break open. So while any weapon can bash open a novice lock, you'd need a steel weapon or better to break open an apprentice lock, and so on, until you need your daedric or dragonbone to access the master locks. While this could feel like a hindrance, I think it's a nice way to balance it, since you could rely on crafting, looting or just having luck finding a good weapon to break open locks. And you can still of course just lockpick it.

There are other modpacks that add unlock spells, so I left those out of this one. I might add them in the future, but for now I'm happy with this.
